# Information Management Website

**Skills:** _HTML_, _PHP_, _MySQL_

## Prerequisite

To run `PHP` scripts locally, we need to install `XAMPP` to provide a local host webserver that supports `PHP` and `MySQL`. After installation of `XAMPP`, place the web pages under `XAMPP > htdocs`.

## Functionalities

This is a simple information management website implemented by `PHP` and `MySQL`.

One can sign up by registration of personal information. After creation of one's account, one can sign in and update one's information.

The `administrator` (`Username:` admin, `Password:` 000000) has the privilege to delete accounts and grant/revoke admin permissions to other accounts.
